## How to play
---

This game is based on the classic [Battleships game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

When the game starts an info area is displayed at the top, containing info about the game. The player is then prompted to enter a name. The boards are drawn up and the player can now enter co-ordinates.

The player can see their ships, marked with an **__S__**, on their board. The computer ships are hidden.
Hits are marked with **__*__** and misses with **__M__*.
